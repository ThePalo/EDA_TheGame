# EDA_TheGame
This is my practice of the final game of EDA, an UPC-FIB subject of Computer Science degree. 

You can read what is this practice about and how to play in Game_Brief.pdf.

I did 3 solutions: Palo_MkIII, Palo_MkIV and Palo_MkV. All of them are based on BFS Algorithms (and some Dijsktra), but as I was learning that kind of algorithms while I did this, they can have some mistakes. If you find something wrong, feel free to change it!
If you want to play, remember that you have my players and AIDemo (AIDummy has been removed because it could contain some problems).
